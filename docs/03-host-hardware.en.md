# 3. Host & Device Setup

A gripper being **listed** is not the same as it being **openable** — this chapter covers serial
permissions, ModemManager contention, the device auto-discovery rules, and the hardware power-on
order.

!!! danger "[3.1 Serial permissions](#31) and [3.2 keeping ModemManager off](#32) are required"
    Both are **one-off host setup** and hold indefinitely once done.

## 3.1 Serial permissions (dialout) {#31}

The gripper MCU enumerates as `/dev/ttyACM*`, owned by group `dialout`. A user outside that group
can have the SDK *list* grippers but **cannot open the port to read the firmware serial**, so
`scan_grippers()` reports `role=Unknown` with an empty `firmware_sn`, and connecting fails:

```text
RuntimeError: No leader gripper discovered for the left side.
# underneath: IoError: SerialBus: open(/dev/serial/by-id/...): Permission denied
```

Join the group once, then **log back in** for it to take effect:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout "$USER"
# log out and back in (or run newgrp dialout in this shell), then re-plug the gripper
```

Verify — `role` must be `Leader`/`Follower` (not `Unknown`) and `firmware_sn` non-empty:

```bash
python -c "from xense.taccap import scan_grippers
for g in scan_grippers(): print(g.side.name, g.role.name, repr(g.firmware_sn))"
```

!!! warning "Serial still empty?"
    If `firmware_sn` stays empty after fixing permissions, the SN may not be burned in, the serial
    read may still be failing, firmware communication may be faulty, or the device may be
    misconfigured — an empty SN alone is not enough to infer a firmware version. Save the full
    error, retest with a different cable and port, and contact the device or firmware team if it
    persists.

## 3.2 Stop ModemManager grabbing the port (udev) {#32}

!!! info "On the Docker delivery image this is already done"
    `install_customer.sh` installs the udev rule below on the **host** (a container cannot manage
    the host's hot-plug rules). This section stays as the explanation and as a troubleshooting
    reference — you do not need to redo it.

The gripper MCU is a CH343 USB-serial device (`1a86:55d2`, CDC-ACM). On every hot-plug,
**ModemManager** (the default cellular-modem service on Ubuntu/GNOME) probes the fresh port with
AT commands and holds it open for a few seconds, so connecting fails during that window:

```text
IoError: SerialBus: open(/dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB_Dual_Serial_..-if02): Device or resource busy
```

!!! note "Typical symptom"
    The **first** launch works (the port has settled), but unplug → different USB port → relaunch
    immediately gives **busy**. This is **not** a tactile, camera or bandwidth problem. (If the
    braille driver `brltty` is installed, it grabs `1a86` the same way.) Stopgap: wait ~3 s after
    plugging in.

Permanent fix — a udev rule telling ModemManager to ignore these devices (real modems are
unaffected):

```bash
sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-taccap-ignore-modemmanager.rules >/dev/null <<'EOF'
# XTac-UMI G1 MCUs are CH343 USB-serial (1a86:55d2) — keep ModemManager off them
ACTION=="add|change", SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1a86", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"
EOF
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

Verify:

```bash
udevadm info -q property -n /dev/ttyACM0 | grep ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE   # -> ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE=1
mmcli -L                                                               # gripper no longer listed
```

Delete the rule file and reload to revert. (On a dedicated robot host with no cellular module you
can also `sudo systemctl disable --now ModemManager`.)

## 3.3 Device auto-discovery and the odd-left/even-right rule {#33}

Every device is **auto-discovered by serial number + USB topology** and assigned to `left`/`right`
— **no serials are hand-listed**.

### Serial grammar

| Device | Grammar | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Gripper | `TCGU01<batch><line><seq><m\|s>` | `TCGU01A24Z0002m` |
| Tactile | `GSPS01<batch><line><seq>` | `GSPS01A25Z0011` |
| Camera | `XC<batch><line><seq><m\|s>` | `XCA24Z0007m` |

`<seq>` is 4 digits; patch `m` → leader, `s` → follower.

### Side rule (odd-left / even-right)

The **last digit** of the 4-digit sequence: **odd → left, even → right**. This governs gripper and
camera side, and which of a gripper's **two fingertip tactile sensors** is which.

### Tactile left/right → `{side}_tactile_{left,right}`

Combines USB topology with the side rule:

- **Which gripper (side)**: the two GSPS sensors sharing a gripper's **USB hub** are that
  gripper's pair. That gripper's side is read from its **firmware SN** (the side reported by
  `scan_grippers()`) — **not** the CH343 `mcu_serial`. So: hub → gripper → side.
- **Which fingertip tactile sensor (left/right)**: the **last digit** of the GSPS serial (odd-left / even-right).

### Pico4 Ultra Enterprise tracker — a different serial system

Tracker serials look like `PC2310MLL3200496G`, ending in the letter `G`. **The side is the digit
in front of that `G`: odd is left, even is right** — above, that digit is `6`, even, so the
tracker is on the **right**. The SN has to be read from the PC Service; it is not shown on the
headset — see [Reading a tracker SN](#pico-tracker-sn).

!!! note "Mis-burned / mis-installed hardware fails explicitly"
    Discovery **fails outright and names** the offending hub/serial when it meets a
    non-conforming serial, the wrong count on a side, two fingertip sensors mapping to the same side, two
    grippers claiming the same tactile side, or a tactile hub with no matching gripper — so the
    physical rig and the fields in your data cannot silently drift apart.

!!! tip "Check the side that has **two**"
    A side coming up empty usually means its device **put itself on the other side**, so
    discovery reports duplicates before gaps — re-check the serials on the **side with two**
    against the side rule above, rather than hunting for the one that "went missing".

## 3.4 Pico4 Ultra Enterprise setup {#34}

The **standalone motion tracker** that ships with the Pico4 Ultra Enterprise mounts on top of the
gripper and provides the 6-DoF pose. **XTac-UMI XR** (the VR client app) runs on the headset,
and the pose reaches collection via the [XenseVR PC Service](#35). This section is written for
**configuring a new Pico from scratch**, in the order **unbox and update → system settings →
install the app → network → bind the tracker → tracking mode and UI → startup alignment**.

!!! tip "Given a factory-configured headset? Skip ahead"
    Developer mode, the power policy, the app, the tracker binding and the tracking mode are all
    set at the factory and stored on the headset — anything marked **"skip on a pre-configured
    headset"** does not apply to you.

    **Start at [Connect the network](#pico-network)**: plug the USB in, short-press the tracker
    until the LED is solid blue, [open the app and tap Reconnect](#pico-toolkit-ui), then
    [align the frame](#pico-frame). Those three are needed **before every session** either way.

### Unboxing and the system update {#pico-unbox}

!!! info "Skip this section on a pre-configured headset"
    What this section sets is stored on the headset and survives power cycles. A unit configured at
    the factory needs none of it again — unless it is factory-reset or swapped.

**1. Unbox**: peel the protective sticker off the front sensor bar, the tape off the controllers
and the sticker off the lenses, then hold the power button to switch it on.

=== "Sealed box"

    ![PICO 4 Ultra Enterprise, sealed](assets/pico4/unbox-box.jpg){ width="440" }

=== "Front sticker"

    ![Protective sticker on the front sensor bar](assets/pico4/unbox-film.png){ width="440" }

=== "Sticker removed"

    ![The headset with the sticker peeled off](assets/pico4/unbox-film-done.jpg){ width="440" }

=== "Controller tape"

    ![Tape holding the controllers](assets/pico4/unbox-controller-tape.png){ width="440" }

=== "Lens sticker"

    ![Protective sticker on the lenses](assets/pico4/unbox-lens-sticker.jpg){ width="440" }

=== "Power on"

    ![Hold the power button to switch it on](assets/pico4/unbox-power-on.png){ width="440" }

**2. Update the system** — **required on a new unit**: join a **WiFi network with internet
access**, go to **Settings → System update** and hit **Download and install** to reach
**5.15.5.U or later**. The package is about 1.9 GB, so allow time for the download and reboot.

![Settings → System update, offering 5.15.5.U](assets/pico4/system-update.jpg){ width="560" }

!!! danger "A new headset has to be updated first"
    It ships on an older build and **only works properly once updated**. Do this before pairing
    the tracker or installing the app.

### System settings: developer mode and power policy {#pico-system}

!!! info "Skip this section on a pre-configured headset"
    What this section sets is stored on the headset and survives power cycles. A unit configured at
    the factory needs none of it again — unless it is factory-reset or swapped.

**1. Enable developer mode**: on the headset, Settings → About → tap "Software version" several
times → "Developer options" appears on the left → turn on **USB debugging**.

=== "Open Settings"

    ![Library → Settings](assets/pico4/devmode.png){ width="480" }

=== "Tap the build number"

    ![About → tap the software version repeatedly](assets/pico4/devmode-tap-version.png){ width="480" }

=== "Developer options + USB debugging"

    ![Developer options appears; turn on USB debugging](assets/pico4/devmode-usb-debug.png){ width="480" }

**2. Disable sleep and screen-off**: with developer mode on, go to Enterprise Settings → System
Settings → **Power policy** and set both to "**Never**", **in this order**:

1. **System sleep = Never** first;
2. **Screen off = Never** second;
3. While you are there, set **Battery and charging icon** to **Always show** — handy for
   checking the charge mid-session.

=== "Enterprise Settings"

    Tap **Enterprise Settings** in Developer options.

    ![Developer options → Enterprise Settings](assets/pico4/power-step1-enterprise.jpg){ width="480" }

=== "System Settings → Power policy"

    ![Enterprise Settings → System Settings → Power policy](assets/pico4/power-step2-policy.jpg){ width="480" }

=== "Defaults, before the change"

    It ships as **screen-off 30 s, system sleep 5 min, battery icon hidden** — all three change.

    ![The power policy at its factory defaults](assets/pico4/power-step3-before.jpg){ width="480" }

=== "Final settings"

    ![Power policy: screen-off and system sleep both Never, battery icon always shown](assets/pico4/power-step4-final.png){ width="480" }

When you are done it should match "**Final settings**": **screen-off Never, system sleep Never,
battery icon always shown**.

!!! warning "The order matters"
    The screen-off timeout is bounded by the system sleep timeout. Set screen-off first, while
    system sleep is still at its default, and "Never" gets clamped back to a finite value — it
    looks set but is not in effect. **Sleep first, screen-off second**, then leave Settings and
    come back to confirm both read "Never".

Skipping this: once the headset screen-blanks or sleeps between episodes, **XTac-UMI XR gets
suspended or killed by the system** and tracking drops out. Restarting the XTac-UMI XR re-freezes the
world origin and orientation, leaving poses inside one dataset referenced to different frames
(see [Frame alignment](#pico-frame)). Simply setting the headset down triggers it too, so it must
be turned off — "don't take the headset off" is not a workaround.

!!! note "This lives in Enterprise Settings, not the normal ones"
    "Power policy" is only offered in the **Pico Enterprise** edition's Enterprise Settings; the
    consumer settings menu has no such item and cannot set screen-off to "Never".

### Installing XTac-UMI XR (Pico4 Ultra Enterprise) {#pico-app}

!!! info "Skip this section on a pre-configured headset"
    What this section sets is stored on the headset and survives power cycles. A unit configured at
    the factory needs none of it again — unless it is factory-reset or swapped.

=== "Copy the apk (PC side)"

    Connect the headset to the PC over USB and copy `XTac-UMI-XR-0.1.X.apk` into the headset's
    `Download/` directory (`0.1.X` is the version — use whichever build you were given).

    ![The apk copied into the Pico's Download folder, seen from the PC](assets/pico4/install-step1-copy.jpg){ width="480" }

=== "Find it on the headset"

    Put the headset on, open **File Manager** from the taskbar, and go into **Download**.

    ![File Manager → Download](assets/pico4/install-step2-filemanager.png){ width="480" }

=== "Install and confirm"

    Tap `XTac-UMI-XR-0.1.X.apk` and choose **Install** in the "Install this app?" dialog.

    ![Confirming the install](assets/pico4/install-step3-confirm.png){ width="480" }

    Back in the **Library**, the app appears as **XTac-UMI XR**.

    ![The apk in the installer list, and XTac-UMI XR in the library once installed](assets/pico4/install-step3-done.jpg){ width="480" }

### Network connection (important) {#pico-network}

Tracking data has to reach the XenseVR PC Service on the collection PC. **Both wired and wireless
work**:

| Link | How |
|---|---|
| **Wired USB shared network** (recommended) | Type-C straight to the collection PC; the headset assigns it an IP |
| WiFi | Headset and collection PC on the **same network**, no cable |

!!! tip "Prefer the wired link for collection"
    **In a busy WiFi environment — congested channels, interference — the wireless link suffers**,
    showing up as a stuttering or jittery pose, or dropped data, none of which is easy to tell
    apart from other faults. The wired shared network is steadier and is what to use for real
    collection; wireless suits quick checks or setups where a cable is impractical.

**Wired setup:**

1. On the headset: Settings → Developer options → enable "USB debugging" → set "USB connection"
   to "**File transfer**". **Re-check this after every USB re-plug** — it reverts to the default.
   If you cannot select it, reboot the Pico and try again.
2. **Start the service on the PC first** (see [§3.5](#35)): `runService.sh`.
3. Open **XTac-UMI XR**, tap "**Reconnect**", and the status reads "**Connected**" (see
   [the app's screen](#pico-toolkit-ui)).

Over **WiFi**, put the headset and the collection PC on the **same network**; everything else is
the same.

!!! warning "The service has to be up before you open the app"
    The app connects to the XenseVR PC Service on the host. **With the service down, the app just
    sits on "Not connected".** Run `runService.sh` first, then open the app.

!!! danger "On the wired link, turn the collection PC's WiFi off"
    The wired shared network **conflicts with other networks on the PC — WiFi above all**
    (routing and interface contention), leaving the tracker unreachable or its pose unstable.
    **If you are on the cable, turn the PC's WiFi off**, keeping only the headset's shared
    network.

![USB connection set to file transfer](assets/pico4/usb-shared-network.jpg){ width="520" }

### Binding the motion tracker to the headset {#pico-tracker-bind}

!!! info "Skip this section on a pre-configured headset"
    What this section sets is stored on the headset and survives power cycles. A unit configured at
    the factory needs none of it again — unless it is factory-reset or swapped.

**On first use, or after swapping a tracker**, the PICO Motion Tracker must be bound to **this
headset**. Until it is, it cannot be selected in tracking mode, and neither XTac-UMI XR nor the
PC Service will discover its SN.

!!! tip "Scan the QR code on the back of the tracker first"
    It gives you that tracker's full SN, so you can confirm the right one during pairing instead
    of checking against the PC Service afterwards. **Mount each tracker on the side its SN says**
    (odd-left / even-right, see [3.3](#33)): **odd on the left gripper, even on the right**.

    | Scan this | You get this |
    |---|---|
    | ![The QR code on the back of the tracker](assets/pico4/tracker-sn-qr.jpg){ width="300" } | ![Scan result, left tracker](assets/pico4/tracker-sn-left.png){ width="320" }<br>`1` before the `G` — odd → **left** gripper<br><br>![Scan result, right tracker](assets/pico4/tracker-sn-right.png){ width="320" }<br>`8` before the `G` — even → **right** gripper |

    The six boxed digits are the number shown in the "**My trackers**" list after pairing (e.g.
    `Tracker 150311`) — that is how you tell which list entry is which physical tracker.

1. Open the **Motion Tracker** app from the **Library** and go to the **pairing screen**.
2. **Hold the tracker's power button for about 6 seconds**, until the indicator **alternates blue
   and red** — that is Bluetooth pairing mode (steady blue is just powered on, not pairing, and
   the app will not find it).
3. Tap "**Start pairing**" and wait. **The headset plays a tone when pairing succeeds** — that
   sound is your confirmation. The tracker then appears in the "**My trackers**" list with its
   battery level and number (e.g. `Tracker 150399`), marked "**Connected**".
4. **One tracker per gripper — bind both.** The top of the list should read "**2 paired**".

!!! tip "Power-on is a short press; only pairing needs the hold"
    **Everyday power-on** is a **short press** — the LED goes solid blue.
    **Only first-time binding** needs the ~6 s hold until it **alternates blue and red**; the rest
    of the time, do not hold it into pairing mode.

=== "Open the Motion Tracker app"

    Open **Motion Tracker** from the **Library**.

    ![Library → Motion Tracker](assets/pico4/tracker-app-open.png){ width="440" }

=== "Go to the pairing screen"

    On the "PICO Motion Tracker" main screen, tap the **icon in the top-right corner** to open the
    pairing screen.

    ![Motion Tracker main screen; the top-right icon opens pairing](assets/pico4/tracker-pair-entry.png){ width="440" }

=== "My trackers: 2 paired"

    ![Motion Tracker app: both trackers connected](assets/pico4/tracker-bind.jpg){ width="440" }

!!! note "Binding is one-off; unpair from the ⓘ menu"
    The binding is stored on the headset and survives everyday power cycles and app restarts.
    Re-bind only after swapping trackers, moving to another headset, or a factory reset. When
    **replacing a device**, unpair from the **ⓘ** on the right of the list entry first, then bind
    the new one.

!!! warning "In standalone tracking mode the tracker must stay in the headset's view"
    The app says so itself. A tracker occluded for long by your body, the desk edge or the other
    hand will **lose tracking**, which shows up as pose jumps or a frozen pose. Mind your working
    posture so the tracker on top of the gripper does not leave the headset's view for long.

#### Reading a tracker SN {#pico-tracker-sn}

The SN determines the side (the digit before the trailing `G`, odd-left / even-right — see [3.3](#33)) and is
also how the PC Service identifies a tracker.

This SN is not visible on the headset: the "Motion Tracker" app only shows a **short number** (e.g.
`Tracker 150399`), and the SN on XTac-UMI XR's Network panel (e.g. `PA9410MGL…`) is the
**headset's own**. The **full tracker SN** you need for side matching (shaped like
`PC2310MLL3200496G`) is read with the PC Service's Python interface `xensevr_pc_service_sdk`:

```python
import xensevr_pc_service_sdk as xrt

xrt.init()
print(xrt.get_motion_tracker_serial_numbers())   # e.g. ['PC2310MLL3200496G', ...]
```

!!! warning "Reading SNs needs the whole chain up first"
    `get_motion_tracker_serial_numbers()` reports the trackers the service is **currently
    receiving data from**. So first: tracker bound and powered on → XTac-UMI XR showing
    ["Connected"](#pico-toolkit-ui) → [XenseVR PC Service](#35) running on the
    host. Miss any one and you get an empty list.

With the SN in hand you can pin it via `--robot.tracker_serial=<SN>` and skip auto-matching.
**Shake one gripper at a time** to confirm which SN is which hand before writing it into your
config.

### Tracking mode and XTac-UMI XR settings {#pico-tracker}

!!! info "Skip this section on a pre-configured headset"
    What this section sets is stored on the headset and survives power cycles. A unit configured at
    the factory needs none of it again — unless it is factory-reset or swapped.

Once bound:

1. Open "**Motion Tracking**" on the headset.
2. In its settings, set the tracking mode to "**Standalone tracking**".

=== "Find \"Tracking mode\" in Settings"

    It ships as "**Full-body motion capture**" — trackers worn on the body to follow a human
    pose, which is not what we want.

    ![Settings → Tracking mode](assets/pico4/tracker-mode1-entry.png){ width="480" }

=== "Choose \"Standalone tracking\""

    "**Standalone tracking**" fixes a tracker to an object and follows that object's pose — which
    is what a gripper is. Select it and tap **Confirm**.

    ![Tracking mode: pick standalone and confirm](assets/pico4/tracker-mode2-pick.png){ width="480" }

=== "What it looks like afterwards"

    The "Tracking mode" row should now read "**Standalone tracking**".

    ![Settings showing tracking mode set to standalone](assets/pico4/tracker-mode3-done.png){ width="480" }


The XenseVR PC Service identifies trackers by **serial number (SN)**; the side is matched
automatically from the digit before the trailing `G`, odd-left / even-right (see [3.3](#33)), or pinned
with `--robot.tracker_serial=<SN>`.

### The app's screen {#pico-toolkit-ui}

With the headset on, open **XTac-UMI XR** from the **Library**. The screen is small: **Status**,
**Resolution** and **Reconnect** (plus "Collapse" on the left, which folds the panel away).
**What you want is Status reading "Connected"** — until then the PC reads no pose at all.

**There is no PC IP to enter**: once the [wired shared network](#pico-network) is up, the app
finds the XenseVR PC Service on the host by itself — but **you have to tap "Reconnect"** to
connect. Opening the app does not connect it.

=== "Open the app"

    Open **XTac-UMI XR** from the **Library**.

    ![Library → XTac-UMI XR](assets/pico4/app-step1-open.png){ width="480" }

=== "Status: Not connected"

    It opens on "**Status: Not connected**". **Tap "Reconnect"** — it does not connect by itself,
    however long you wait.

    ![XTac-UMI XR: status not connected](assets/pico4/app-step2-disconnected.jpg){ width="420" }

=== "Allow camera access"

    On first launch it asks whether to allow XTac-UMI XR to use the camera. Tap "**Allow**" —
    the [headset camera](05-data-collection.md#56) needs it, and denying leaves you without
    headset frames.

    ![Allow XTac-UMI XR to use the camera](assets/pico4/app-step3-camera.png){ width="380" }

=== "Status: Connected"

    "**Status: Connected**" is the state you collect from.

    ![XTac-UMI XR: status connected](assets/pico4/app-step4-connected.jpg){ width="420" }

!!! tip "\"Resolution\" is the headset's stereo camera resolution"
    It sets the capture resolution of the [headset camera](05-data-collection.md#56) and defaults
    to `1024`; it does nothing if you are not using that camera. Leave it alone unless you have a
    reason.

    **Change it here and the collection command has to follow**: at `1280`, pass
    `--robot.head_camera_width=1280 --robot.head_camera_height=960`, or connect fails on the
    frame size.

!!! note "High-accuracy tracking is always on now"
    High-accuracy tracking — steadier pose, less jitter — is enabled by default. There is no
    toggle for it and nothing to set.

!!! warning "Still not connecting?"
    If Reconnect leaves it on "Not connected", the problem is usually not the app but
    [the network](#pico-network): the wired shared network is not up, or the PC's WiFi is
    still on.

!!! tip "Self-check: is the PC actually receiving?"
    Once it says Connected, confirm on the host that a pose with an `sn` comes through — via
    `ConsoleDemo` in `/opt/apps/roboticsservice/` or
    `python -m lerobot.robots.taccap_gripper.check_tracker`. The headset saying it is
    connected and the host actually receiving data are two different things.

### Startup and frame alignment {#pico-frame}

**Wear the headset and face straight towards the robot when you launch XTac-UMI XR**, then
tap "**Reconnect**" to get [Status to "Connected"](#pico-toolkit-ui). The moment it launches, the
**world frame's origin and orientation are frozen**.

Recorded poses land in a **gravity-aligned world frame**: **+X = straight ahead, +Y = left,
+Z = up**.

The picture below is that world frame — **the origin sits where the headset was at the moment of
launch**, with **red = X (forward), green = Y (left), blue = Z (up)**:

![The world frame frozen at the headset's position at launch: red X forward, green Y left, blue Z up](assets/pico4/world-frame-origin.png){ width="420" }

The frame is drawn on the headset, but it only follows the headset for that one instant — once
frozen it stays put in space, and **turning your head or walking around does not carry it with
you**. Every `tcp.*` pose in the dataset is referenced to this fixed frame.

!!! warning "Face straight towards the robot at launch"
    Facing straight ahead is what aligns world +X with the robot's forward direction (Y left, Z
    up). **Only the orientation matters** — where you stand (the origin) does not affect later
    use.

!!! warning "Do not restart XTac-UMI XR between episodes"
    A restart changes the origin and orientation for everything recorded afterwards, leaving poses
    inside one dataset referenced to different frames.

## 3.5 Start the XenseVR PC Service {#35}

The tracker talks to the host's **XenseVR PC Service** (RoboticsService) daemon, which handles
device discovery, status monitoring and live tracking-data distribution. Collection reads poses
from it.

!!! info "On the Docker delivery image the service starts itself"
    The container launches it, so the command below is not needed. When you only work on data and
    do not need the tracker, turn it off with `START_XENSEVR_SERVICE=0` (see
    [2. Environment Setup · Docker](02-environment.md#docker)).

Start it:

```bash
/opt/apps/roboticsservice/runService.sh
```

!!! note "Only one instance at a time"
    The service allows a single instance; starting a second one fails or conflicts.

The service can supply several kinds of tracking data (headset Head / controllers / hand tracking /
full-body mocap / **standalone Tracker**). Collection uses two of them:

- **Standalone Tracker pose** — the grippers' pose; the data carries an `sn` distinguishing the
  trackers.
- **Head pose** — the headset's own pose, used together with the
  [headset's stereo frames](05-data-collection.md#56).

!!! note "The headset camera and head pose run through this service too"
    They are not a separate link: the headset sends each eye's frames and its own pose to the PC
    Service, which forwards them to collection. So **they share one service and one connection
    with the trackers** — no service, neither works.

    Two things enable this path: a service at **v0.2.0 or later** (see
    [2.4 One-shot install](02-environment.md)) and **XTac-UMI XR** installed on the headset. If
    you only use trackers, the service version makes no difference.

!!! tip "Verifying the service and devices"
    The service directory ships `ConsoleDemo` / `RobotDemoQt` demos
    (`/opt/apps/roboticsservice/`) for confirming the headset was discovered and tracking data
    looks right (they need the same runtime environment as the service).

## 3.6 Hardware power-on order {#36}

!!! note "Startup order"
    The standard order is below (app screens follow whichever version you have):

1. Plug the XTac-UMI G1 into the host (USB).
2. Connect the headset's **wired shared network** and **turn the collection PC's WiFi off**
   (see [3.4 Network connection](#pico-network)).
3. Power on the headset, and **short-press** the tracker's power button until the **blue light comes on**
   (first use needs [binding](#pico-tracker-bind) first).
4. Start the host's XenseVR PC Service (`runService.sh`).
5. **Facing straight towards the robot**, launch the XTac-UMI XR app (this **freezes the world
   origin and orientation** — see [frames](#pico-frame)), and check that its
   tap "**Reconnect**" so the [status reads "Connected"](#pico-toolkit-ui).
6. Run the calibration / self-check / recording scripts.

!!! warning "Step 4 has to come before step 5"
    The app connects to that service. **With it down, the app sits on "Not connected"** — and
    restarting the app to retry resets the world origin all over again.

!!! warning "An uncalibrated leader is refused at connect"
    `gripper.pos` in the dataset is a normalised opening (`0.0` closed / `1.0` open), and those two
    endpoints come from the **encoder zero** and **travel span** written into MCU flash. **A leader
    with no stored travel span will not connect** — the program exits with the calibration command
    in the error, so there is nothing for you to judge: if it connects, it was calibrated.

    The values live in flash and survive power cycles and host changes. Once per unit is enough;
    this is not a routine step before every session.

    Bimanual rigs especially: **calibrating only one side leaves the two channels on different
    scales**, so the same physical grip reads differently on each side, with nothing in the data
    to show it. If you calibrate one, calibrate both:

    ```bash
    python third_party/taccap-gripper/python/examples/calibrate.py left
    python third_party/taccap-gripper/python/examples/calibrate.py right
    ```
